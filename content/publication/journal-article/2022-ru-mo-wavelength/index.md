  The 4s 2 4p 2 P 3/2–2 P 1/2 magnetic dipole transition in Ga-like ions is interested in developing of high precise highly charged ion clock (Yu and Sahoo 2019 Phys. Rev. A 99 022513). In this work, we present direct observations of the transition in Mo 11+ and Ru 13+ ions at an electron beam ion trap. Internal and external calibration methods are used for determining the wavelength of the Mo 11+ and Ru 13+ lines, respectively. Both measurements reach precision levels of a few ppm. Compared with the available values, the current results significantly improve the experimental uncertainty.
summary: Precise wavelength determination of Mo11+ and Ru13+ ions.
