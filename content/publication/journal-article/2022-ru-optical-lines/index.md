  In this work, we report a spectroscopy measurement of Ru21+ to Ru24+ ions in the optical region using a low energy electron beam ion trap. Twelve lines were observed. The multiconfiguration Dirac–Hartree–Fock and relativistic configuration interaction methods were used to calculate the atomic level energies and the transition rates. With the assistance of the theoretical results, eleven magnetic dipole lines were identified. The experimental results provide new reference data for further theoretical investigations of the complex ions.
summary: Optical transition lines of highly charged Ru ions.
