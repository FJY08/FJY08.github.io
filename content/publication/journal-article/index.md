  We present a framework for universal fault-tolerant logic with heterogeneous holographic codes. 
  This work establishes new thresholds for fault tolerance and demonstrates logical gate constructions 
  within holographic quantum error-correcting architectures, inspired by AdS/CFT duality. 
  Featured as a poster at TQC 2025.
summary: Universal fault-tolerant logic with holographic codes (PRX Quantum, 2025).
