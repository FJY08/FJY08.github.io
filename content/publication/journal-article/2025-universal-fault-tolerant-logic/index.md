abstract: |
  We present a framework for universal fault-tolerant logic with heterogeneous holographic codes,
  inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence. The scheme demonstrates new thresholds for quantum error
  correction and logical gate constructions. Featured as a poster at TQC 2025.

summary: Universal fault-tolerant logic with holographic codes (PRX Quantum, 2025).
