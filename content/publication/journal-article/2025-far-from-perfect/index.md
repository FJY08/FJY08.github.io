abstract: |
  We analyze error correction with hyperinvariant Evenbly codes, discussing limitations 
  and new possibilities for holographic-style constructions. Our results provide insights 
  into practical decoding strategies and performance bounds for this family of tensor-network codes.

summary: Error correction with hyperinvariant Evenbly codes.
